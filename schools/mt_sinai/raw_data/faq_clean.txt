We are here to help&mdash;and we encourage you to reach out&nbsp;to us if you don&rsquo;t see your question addressed in our Frequently Asked Questions. Discover Medical Education Apply Now Eligibility and Application Requirements for MD Program Admissions What courses are required for admission? Potential applicants who are curious about which courses are required for admission should start by reviewing our application and matriculation requirements. All academic requirements must be completed before matriculation. Do I have to take the labs associated with the biology or chemistry courses? Prior to matriculation, you are required to complete a year of lab in biology and/or chemistry. Can I take my courses at a community college, or must I take them at a four-year college or university? Our MD Program Admissions Committee is committed to an equitable process that considers each applicant&rsquo;s unique journey to the field of medicine. Pre-requisite courses completed at the community college level or in an online format will be considered on a case-by-case basis. If these required courses are fulfilled with community college level coursework, it is recommended for applicants to complete additional higher-level courses in related subjects at a four-year accredited institution. It is strongly preferred that applicants complete courses taken on-site/in-person. Laboratory sciences requirements should not be taken in an online format. I haven't completed one of the required courses. Can I still apply? Yes. However, should you be offered an acceptance, it will be contingent upon the successful completion of all requirements prior to matriculation. As an international student, can I apply to the MD program? Yes, we accept applications from international students. If you received an undergraduate degree in the United States, you will go through the same process as U.S. citizens. If you received your undergraduate degree abroad, we will need a course-by-course evaluation of your transcript by a&nbsp;NACES member organization&nbsp;sent to our Admissions Office directly, as the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC) will not be able to verify your information. Keep in mind that it is highly recommended that you have taken some coursework in the United States. This can be post-baccalaureate or graduate-level coursework. Can I apply if I have Deferred Action for Childhood Arrival (DACA) status? Applicants with DACA status are considered in the same application pool as all other candidates. If admitted, DACA students are eligible for institutional financial aid from Icahn Mount Sinai. Students are responsible for obtaining and maintaining DACA status. Please visit our Office of Student Financial Services. Do you accept transfer students? We do not accept transfer applications. What are the oldest Medical College Admission Test (MCAT) scores you accept? We will accept MCAT scores &nbsp;within 5 years of application. How do I receive a fee waiver for my supplemental application? We only grant fee waivers if you have secured&nbsp;AAMC Fee Assistance Program&nbsp;approval. If this approval is indicated on your American Medical College Application Service (AMCAS) application, it will automatically appear when you complete the online supplemental application. How many letters of recommendation do I need to submit? We only accept letters of recommendation through AMCAS, and a letter of recommendation from your premedical advisory committee is preferred. If you do not have a pre-health advisor or committee at your current institution, you must submit three to six letters of recommendation from people who can speak to your passion for a career in medicine, as well as your intellectual journey. These sources may include research mentors, professional or service supervisors, professors, or clinical preceptors. Additional letters may be sent as an application update. What is the policy on providing application updates? Applicants may submit updates to their application throughout the admissions cycle, through the secondary application portal under the &ldquo;Document upload&rdquo; tab. If I get accepted to the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai through regular admissions, can I still apply to the MSTP (MD-PhD Program) in my second year? While most MSTP students initially apply to Icahn Mount Sinai for this program, our students can apply for the MD-PhD Program during their second year of medical school. Can I visit the school? Accepted applicants are invited to visit and tour the school during our&nbsp;Explore Icahn: Revisit Weekend. Can I meet with an admissions counselor? We do not provide admissions counseling, so we encourage applicants to speak with the premedical advisors at their current institution. How selective is the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai? Icahn Mount Sinai receives more than 7,000 completed applications for the 120 positions of each entering class. We use a holistic review process that considers a variety of academic and experiential factors. Are applicants who are residents of the State of New York treated differently than nonresidents? We make no distinction among applicants based on their state of residency, either in the admissions process or in associated fees. Admitted Students What are the tuition and fees? For information on tuition and fees, please visit the&nbsp;Office of Student Financial Services. Are students guaranteed housing? Housing&nbsp;is guaranteed for students enrolled on a full-time basis in the MD (and the MD-PhD) Program. Most MD students will be assigned student housing in the Jane B. Aron Residence Hall, which is across the street from Icahn Mount Sinai. On-campus housing for eligible student couples is available as well. Student Life Where can I find information about student life and resources at Icahn Mount Sinai? Information regarding student housing, student government, and a list of student organizations and services is provided through our&nbsp;Student Life and Resources. Additionally, you&rsquo;ll have the opportunity to meet students representing these organizations throughout the planned events of orientation. What diversity initiatives or programs can I be involved with as a student at Icahn Mount Sinai? At Icahn Mount Sinai, we address this ongoing priority through Mount Sinai Health System's&nbsp;Office for Diversity and Inclusion, and its&nbsp;Patricia S. Levinson Center for Multicultural and Community Affairs, our longstanding diversity center. Do I need a car while I’m a student at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai? Probably not. In fact, most Icahn Mount Sinai students do not have a car while living in New York City. The School and The Mount Sinai Hospital are within walking distance of student housing, and all additional clinical sites are accessible via public transit.
