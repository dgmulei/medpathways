Icahn Mount Sinai understands that the COVID-19 public health crisis affected different facets of each applicant's portfolio. The MD Admissions Committee evaluates each application holistically and will continue to maintain this rigorous method of review. If your application has been impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, consider writing a short explanation in your application.&nbsp; Our MD Program Admissions Committee is committed to an equitable process that considers each applicant&rsquo;s unique journey to the field of medicine. Pre-requisite courses completed at the community college level or in an online format will be considered on a case-by-case basis. If these required courses are fulfilled with community college level coursework, it is recommended for applicants to complete additional higher-level courses in related subjects at a four-year accredited institution. It is strongly preferred that applicants complete courses taken on-site/in-person. Laboratory sciences requirements should not be taken in an online format. Additional Considerations Students may apply to Icahn Mount Sinai if they lack one or two of the premedical requirements, but completion of these courses is required for enrollment. The following considerations also apply: Icahn Mount Sinai does not accept transfer students who have matriculated at another medical school. Students who take courses at institutions outside of the United States or Canada are encouraged to complete additional coursework in the United States to demonstrate preparation for medical school content. We also encourage all applicants to complete coursework and engage in experiences which provide exposure to social determinants of health and disparities in health care outcomes. Coursework examples include sociology, public health, political science, global health, bioethics, urban studies, history, and economics.&nbsp; We encourage you to&nbsp;reach out&nbsp;with any questions you may have.

We interview approximately 700 students each year from a pool of approximately 7,000 applicants for the traditional Medical Education Program&nbsp;pathway. Applicants who are offered an interview spend a day meeting students and faculty. Each applicant invited for an interview is randomly assigned two 30-minute interviews with members of the MD Admissions Committee. Their application, letters of recommendation, and secondary application are evaluated fully by both interviewers. &nbsp; Our interviews are semi-structured and traditional in nature. During each session, a holistic assessment of the candidate is conducted based on the following core areas: academics, clinical exposure, community service, research, and other extracurricular activities. Our interviewers also evaluate applicant attributes that align with the School&rsquo;s mission, and assess communication skills. These core areas, applicant attributes, and communication assessment are modeled on the&nbsp; Core Competencies for Entering Medical Students endorsed by the Association of American Medical Colleges Group on Student Affairs. Icahn Mount Sinai&rsquo;s MD Admissions Committee meets on a weekly basis during the admissions cycle, and each interviewed candidate is presented to the committee by the two assigned interviewers.&nbsp;The MD Admissions Committee makes final admissions decisions.
